          <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is shown by
          default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we
          use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance,
          as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify
          any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also
          worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the
          <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
