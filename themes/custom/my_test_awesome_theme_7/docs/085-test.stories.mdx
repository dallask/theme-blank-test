# Tests

## Test runner

Storybook test runner turns all of your stories into executable tests. It is powered by Jest and Playwright.
- For those without a play function: it verifies whether the story renders without any errors.
- For those with a play function: it also checks for errors in the play function and that all assertions passed.

To test storybook integrity you van utilize the next commands (`npm run storibook` should be run prior):
- `npm run test:storybook` - to test all stories at once
- `test:storybook:watch` - to watch changes during development
