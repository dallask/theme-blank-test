# Bootstrap

## Introduction

### Version

The Otsuka storybook uses the Bootstrap framework v5. The full Bootstrap
framework included in the project as a `npm` dependency.

### Structure

You can find all framework files inside the `component/00-bootstrap` folder.
The framework core is in the `js` and `styles` subfolders.

The holistic framework is split into parts to have the possibility to use any
part separately due to performance.

After run `npm run build` you will be able to find the final CSS and JS parts
of the framework inside the `dist/css` and `dist/js` folders.
[<img src="/docs/bootstrap/dist-structure.png" width="320"/>](/docs/bootstrap/dist-structure.png)

All those parts have the relevant libraries in the `*.libraries.yml` file.
They can be added to the appropriate templates or used as dependencies for
other libraries.

### Critical components library

The main part of the framework that is used commonly is included to the critical
library (`components/00-bootstrap/styles/bootstrap.critical.scss`) and
connected to the Drupal global library.

## Usage

### Variables

The Bootstrap framework is a highly customizable and flexible system.

It provides the developers with the feature to change the final look of
any part of the system deeply.

By default the Bootstrap consumes the variables from npm dependency folder as
`@import "~bootstrap/styles/_variables";`

It means that all variables set you can find in the file:
`node_modules/bootstrap/styles/_variables.scss`

Any changes you want to add to the Otsuka Bootstrap build by means of default
Bootstrap variables, you MUST place in the file:
`components/00-bootstrap/styles/_variables.scss`

If you leave this file empty, the Bootstrap will be built by default without
any customisations.

By default, Otsuka Bootstrap build contains only the grid settings that
make it **60-column** instead of 12-column. It allows you to build the grid
system with *1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30* columns, and adjust
columns width more accurately.

You can find this adjustement in the file
`components/00-bootstrap/styles/_variables.scss`:
```
$grid-columns: 60 !default;
$grid-gutter-width: 30px !default;
$grid-row-columns: 30 !default;
```

All current storybook components rely on the fact that grid contains 60 columns.
So, you **MUST** not change this part without utter necessity and without
changes inside all current storybook components and twig templates that
contains “col-*” classes.

To make any other adjustment you should first run `npm run storybook`, visit
the bootstrap component page you want to adjust or restyle, open `Docs` tab or
open the component documents in the original Bootstrap site
(like https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/accordion/#variables),
and place variables for certain components to the
`components/00-bootstrap/styles/_variables.scss` file.

You should separate the variables sections inside the file with the comment
lines as it done in the `node_modules/bootstrap/styles/_variables.scss` file.
You can just copy the comments needed from there.

The best approach is before you apply any other adjustments, you should adjust
the next important points:
1. Fonts
    - family
    - size
    - line-height
1. Colors
    - Colors itself (gray, red, green, cyan, etc.)
    - Colors map (what is “primary”, “secondary”, “warning”, “danger”, etc.)
    - Theme colors ($theme-colors)
    - Link colors ($link-color, $link-hover-color)
    - Any other color-relevant variables
1. Decorations ($link-decoration, $link-hover-decoration)
1. Breakpoints ($grid-breakpoints)
1. Containers ($container-max-widths)
1. Spacers
    - Paddings
    - Margins
1. Borders
    - Border-radius

During adjustment refer to BS documentation and
`node_modules/bootstrap/scss/_variables.scss` file
[<img src="/docs/bootstrap/bootstrap-variables.png" width="100%"/>](/docs/bootstrap/bootstrap-variables.png)

Here is a couple of examples:
  - https://github.com/OAPI-Commercial-IT/theme-abilifymaintenahcp/blob/abilifymaintenahcp10069/themes/custom/abilifymaintena_hcp/assets/src/style/base/bootstrap/_variables.scss
  - https://github.com/OAPI-Commercial-IT/otsk-ace/blob/dev/docroot/themes/custom/wild5_theme/assets/src/style/base/bootstrap/_variables.scss

You should continue adjustments till you see that all your parts or the site
(fonts, colors, containers, buttons, typography, etc.) look as close
as possible to the final design.

After you make sure that further adjustment is impossible by means of
the Bootstrap variables, you can proceed with creating custom styles.

Please pay attention that almost all Bootstrap variables are global.
So, you should make as many adjustments as you need first of all, and as few
adjustments as possible afterward.

Because all subsequent adjustments can affect the final appearance of
the components.

### Tokens first approach
As far as system utilizes Figma Design Tokens, it is logical move to use tokens as a base for all styles adjustments
inside any components and parts of design.

Same approach is applicable for Bootstrap variables.

Current version of Bootstrap variables file `components/00-bootstrap/styles/_variables.scss` contains special SASS
function that maps any Bootstrap variable to the accordant Design Token.

So, to adjust most used variables you should use `tokens/src/figma.tokens.json` file that contains all variables for
managing any aspect of components or Bootstrap itself.

### Classes
The system use combined Bootstrap approach for creating styles and components.
There is a convention of usage Bootstrap classes: all classes are allowed for usage except next.

### Sizing
- `.h-[n]`
- `.w-[n]`
- `.mh-[n]`
- `.mw-[n]`
- `.min-vw-[n]`

### Spacing
- `.m-[n]`
- `.m[d]-[n]`
- `.m[d]-[b]-[n]`
- `.p-[n]`
- `.p[d]-[n]`
- `.p[d]-[b]-[n]`

### Colors
- `.bg-[c]`
- `.text-[c]`
- `.link-[c]`

### Typography
- `.fs-[n]`
- `.fs-[b]-[n]`
- `.fw-[n]`
- `.fw-[b]-[n]`
- `.lh-[n]`
- `.lh-[b]-[n]`

Instead of those classes you should use Bootstrap variables and mixins during styling.

### Mixins
Use bootstrap default mixins, functions and variables as often as you can.
All Bootstrap mixins, variables, utilities and
functions are available globally across all storybook.

#### Breakpoints

E.g. for the breakpoints inside your own components use BS mixins:
```
@include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
  margin-left: auto;
}
```

### Twig namespaces

If you use the Bootstrap components inside your own component, you should use twig namespaces instead of absolute or relative paths:

`{% include "@atoms/buttons/button.twig" %}`

All namespaces for twig are declared in the next files:
- `.storybook/setupTwig.js`
- `[theme_name].info.yml`

### JS namespaces

Inside your own component, you should use JS namespaces instead of absolute or relative paths:

`import accordion from "@organisms/accordion/accordion.twig"; `

All namespaces for JS are declared in the next files:
- `.storybook/main.js `

## Best practices

### **DO**
- Store all non-Bootstrap SCSS variables, mixins, functions in the appropriate
files (`components/00-base/00-defaults/_01-variables.scss`,
`components/00-base/00-defaults/_03-mixins.scss`,
`components/00-base/00-defaults/_04-functions.scss`)

- Store **Bootstrap ONLY** SCSS variables in `components/00-bootstrap/styles/_variables.scss`

- Make as many Bootstrap variables adjustments as you need first of all,
and as few adjustments as possible afterward

- Use bootstrap default mixins and variables as often as you can

- After creating, deleting, refactoring, replacing, renaming components run
`npm run storybook`, `npm run build`, `npm run webpack `
to make sure that the integrity of the system is maintained

- After creating, deleting, refactoring, replacing, renaming components
fix the paths in *.library.yml file and in all dependent components

- Use `container` class inside exact entity template (mostly: block, paragraph,
menu; rare: layout) to have the possibility to create full width paragraphs or blocks

- Use twig namespaces inside your templates (e.g. `@organisms/accordion/accordion.twig`)
(https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules/components/understanding-twig-namespaces)

- Use JS webpack aliases for `import` directives instead of absolute or
relative paths (e.g. `import accordion from "@organisms/accordion/accordion.twig";`)
(https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-webpack-alias)

- Use Bootstrap components from storybook or from the original
Bootstrap site in most cases (same for tags, structures, classes, etc.)

### **DO NOT**
- Use global CSS selectors, or selectors with common names

- Place all SCSS into one file or into global.scss

- Store your SCSS variables wherever you want

- Store Bootstrap SCSS variables wherever you want

- Make a lot of Bootstrap variables adjustments in the final phase of the project

- Use custom mixins and variables as often as you can

- Make import SCSS files inside the `*.story.js` files (all SCSS will
be imported automatically. All SCSS, except those have the prefix `“_”`,
will be built into the dist folder)

- Delete, replace, edit, refactor, rename any component or file you want

- Store your components wherever you want

- Use global `container` class inside page layout

- Use a custom html structure, classes, components without using Bootstrap
