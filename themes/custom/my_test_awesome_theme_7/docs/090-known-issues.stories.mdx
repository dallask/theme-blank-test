## Drupal crashes due to the absence of the `behavior` plugin

### Description
Drupal crashes with the:
`Drupal\Component\Plugin\Exception\PluginNotFoundException` exception.
It can happen right after the installation or after cache rebuild.
[<img src="/docs/known-issues/drupal-crashes-plugin-not-found.png" width="100%"/>](/docs/known-issues/drupal-crashes-plugin-not-found.png)

### Reason
- Drupal ignores the theme folder when it seeks for the modules.

### Solutions
1. Solution:
    - clear all tables in the db that have the `cache_` prefix
    ```
    TRUNCATE `cache_bootstrap`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_config`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_container`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_data`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_default`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_discovery`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_dynamic_page_cache`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_entity`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_menu`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_page`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_render`;
    TRUNCATE `cache_toolbar`;
    ```
2. Solution:
    - Place your modules into `otsk-drupal/docroot/modules/custom` folder
    - Run cache rebuild after that
3. Solution:
    ```
    fin drush -l {sitename}.otsk.docksal.site sqlq “TRUNCATE cache_discovery;”
    ```

## Menu links turn all `#` link anchors to empty anchors

turns it to the empty destination.

Expected:

`<a href="">Link</a>`

### Reason
- no data

### Solutions
- Add some suffix to the `#` symbol (`#[suffix]`, e.g. `#main`, `#top`)

### Proposals
The issue should be investigated and fixed.

## Media is not rendered on the front end in anonymous mode

### Description

## `otsk_ds_media_responsive_image` module Installation issue

### Description
During the installation process drush throws the issue:
` [warning] Entity view display 'media.responsive_image.default': Component 'field_media_mobile_image' was disabled because its settings depend on removed dependencies.`

[<img src="/docs/known-issues/responsive_image.png" width="100%"/>](/docs/known-issues/responsive_image.png)

### Reason
- The module contains dependency to it's own breakpoints. They should be changed after installation.

### Solutions
1. Install module one more time
`drush -l https://ds3.otsk.docksal.site/ pm:enable otsk_ds_media_responsive_image`
2. Go to `Configuration/Media/Responsive image styles` section `/admin/config/media/responsive-image-style`
3. Switch settings from the module to the theme breakpoints

[<img src="/docs/known-issues/responsive_image_breakpoints.png" width="300"/>](/docs/known-issues/responsive_image_breakpoints.png)

4. Uninstall module
`drush -l https://ds3.otsk.docksal.site/ pmu otsk_ds_media_responsive_image`

### Proposals
There is no solution due to unknown theme_name in the installation moment.
