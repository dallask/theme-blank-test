# How to create Drupal library

## On-demand loading

For performance optimization, the feature of separate on-demand library
loading was created.

All CSS and JS files should be separated into parts and loaded only if an
exact component is present on the page.

Webpack config compiles multiple SCSS files into multiple CSS files while
keeping the default style.css. Any SASS file that is not a partial (its filename
is not prefixed with an underscore) will have a file created in `dist/css`.

The main functionality of this feature is present in the `otsuka_ds_preprocess` module

And all parts of CSS/JS related to a certain component should belong to
this component as a separate library.

Those libraries should be attached to the component by means of twig, preprocesses,
or on-demand loading feature in case of paragraphs, menus, blocks, nodes, etc.

For example, “paragraph.scroll-slider” will be automatically attached to the
paragraph with the name “scroll-slider”:

By means of the next functionality:

In most cases you should avoid “attach_library” in the twig template, because
library will be attached to appropriate entity automatically on-demand,
and because constructions like `attach_library('...')` are not processed by
installation functionality of emulsify CLI. So, if you use direct
`attach_library('...')` in templates you should care about library names on
your own.

The same approach works by default for menus, blocks, nodes, regions, views, etc.

The global SCSS code should be placed to the `components/global.scss`

The file `dist/global.css` is already added to the Drupal global library
in `[theme_name].libraries.yml`.

After run `npm run build` you will be able to find the final CSS and JS parts
of the framework inside the `dist/css`, `dist/img` and `dist/js` folders.

Please pay attention that images also will be ganerated SVG sprite and webp
version of `png/jpg/gif` images. It allows you to use progressive webp format.
This requires also modernizr library (which is already included in
`[theme_name].libraries.yml` and using webp-background mixin (available in
`components/00-base/00-defaults/_03-mixins.scss`) or similar solution.
Also, you need webp module in Drupal.

If you need to add some SCSS or JS adjustments just in place in Drupal,
you can use BrowserSync webpack functionality: `npm run webpack`

Please pay attention that you should set the correct localServer URL first in
webpack config right after installation of the emulsify theme (`webpack/config.js`).

## Best practices

### **DO**
- Use Bootstrap libraries as dependencies
- Use Drupal library autoloading feature instead of `attach_library('...')`
- After creating, deleting, refactoring, replacing, renaming components or files
fix the paths in `[theme_name].library.yml` file and in all dependent components
- After creating, deleting, refactoring, replacing, renaming components run
`npm run storybook`, `npm run build`, `npm run webpack` to make sure that
the integrity of the system is maintained

### **DO NOT**
- Delete, replace, edit, refactor, rename any component or file you want
without checking the paths integrity
- Use `attach_library('...')` in twig
