# Styling

## SASS

The current version of the Design System utilizes SASS as a CSS preprocessor and Webpack as a bundler/builder.
All basic stuff and configuration files you can find in the `components/00-base` folder.

### Variables
The most of these needs covered by means of Bootstrap CSS framework (see `Bootstrap` section).

However, there is the possibility to create your own variables. All custom *not Bootstrap related* variables must be
placed in the file `components/00-base/00-defaults/_01-variables.scss`

### Functions
The most of these needs covered by means of Bootstrap CSS framework (see `Bootstrap` section).

There if the special file where you can place your own *not Bootstrap related* SASS functions:
`components/00-base/00-defaults/_04-functions.scss`.

Please pay attention, that function `rem()` is deprecated. You can use `rfs-value` or `rfs-fluid-value` instead.

### Mixins
The most of these needs covered by means of Bootstrap CSS framework (see `Bootstrap` section).

There if the special file where you can place your own *not Bootstrap related* SASS mixins:
`components/00-base/00-defaults/_03-mixins.scss`

### Post CSS
There is the feature `postcss-pxtorem` that allows to transform some CSS values from `px` to `rem` automatically for
the production build during `npm run build` process.

The configuration for the functionality can be found in the `postcss.config.js` file.

So, in most cases you do not need to use additional functions like `rem`, `rfs-value` or `rfs-fluid-value`.

## Best practices

### **DO**
- Use Bootstrap SCSS variables, mixins, functions in most cases
- Use existing mixins prior creating new

### **DO NOT**
- Use deprecated functions or mixins
