# How to Create Component

Most basic components as links, lists, buttons, etc. are already exist in the structure.
To create something bigger, you must utilize those simple particles in accordance with the atomic design approach.

First of all you need to be sure, that you have no any possibility to use existing component for your purpose, and
really need something new.

1. Determine, what kind of component you are going to create:
  - `atom` - does not contain any of other component
  - `molecule` - contain atoms
  - `organism` - contain atoms and molecules
  - `template` - contain atoms, molecules, and organisms
  - `page` - utilize templates to create page types
1. Create an appropriate separate subfolder with the unique name in the appropriate folder inside
`components/{number}-{type}` folder (e.g. `components/03-organisms/{component_name}`)
1. Create next files inside the component folder:
 - `[component_name].stories.jsx`
 - `README.mdx`
 - `[component_name].yml`
 - `[component_name].twig`
 - `[component_name].[modifier].twig` (optional)
 - `_[component_name]-[part-name].scss` (optional)
 - `[component_name].scss` (optional)
 - `[component_name].js` (optional)
1. Fill the `[component_name].stories.jsx` with the certain component
structure/information/controls.
Use any existing components in the `components` folder as an example.
1. Fill the component documentation in the `README.mdx` file
1. Create the component library inside the `*.libraries.yml` file
1. Add SCSS and JS code if it needed (for JS using the Drupal behaviors
approach is mandatory. Behavior name should be unique)
1. Add twig debug in the template
1. Run (or restart) storybook with the “npm run test:storybook” command in the theme folder (Make sure that storybook runs without the issues)
1. Check that your component appears in the Storybook UI
1. Check all component controls to make sure that they really work as expected
1. Check the component `Docs` tab
1. Run build with the `npm run build` command in the theme folder
(Make sure that build runs without the issues)
1. Run build with the `npm run webpack` command in the theme folder
(Make sure that webpack runs without the issues)
1. Fill all component content, behaviors, attributes
1. Create component mapping file in `structure` folder if it needed
1. Check that your component appears in Drupal and looks as expected

## Component twig debug in Drupal

The default Drupal twig debug information will be available only in the Drupal
entity, but not in your nested components (atoms, molecules, etc.).
So, it would be totally difficult to see what exact atom or whatever
is used inside the paragraph or block.

There is a possibility to see what exact template is used inside the Drupal
entity. For example, you can see twig debug information inside any of
components in admin mode on Drupal.

To use this feature, just add the next string inside your component somewhere in block declaration:

`{% include "@base/06-common/_twig_debug.twig" with { component_debug_path: _self} %}`

It will add the next information about certain twig template path:

```
<!-- THEME STORYBOOK DEBUG -->
<!-- OUTPUT from '@organisms/component_name/component_name.twig' -->
```

This functionality is built on `hook_preprocess()` in `*.theme` file and
depends on the global twig debug option that is set in the twig config for Drupal

This preprocess places the next: `\Drupal::service('twig')->isDebug()`
in the twig_debug_on global variable.

## Mapping fields

To create structure mapping fields you can utilize `{{ devel_dump() }}` function from Devel module inside your templates
to visualize the data structure for your component:

## Best practices

### **DO**
- Use existing components
- Use existing particles as inclusion in the components
- Define the default values for all twig variables inside the component
- Place component SCSS into a separated component-related SCSS file
- Use BEM approach for style encapsulation to avoid CSS overriding
- Use bootstrap default mixins and variables as often as you can
- Store all images for the components in `[component_name]/images` folder
- Each component in Storybook **MUST** have its own folder and its
own `*.story.js` file (the same for the component variants)
- Avoid placing complex logic inside the twig template
- Store the paragraph's extra settings in behaviors or twig variables
- After creating, deleting, refactoring, replacing, renaming components
run `npm run test:storybook`, `npm run storybook`, `npm run build`, `npm run webpack`
to make sure that the integrity of the system is maintained
- After creating, deleting, refactoring, replacing, renaming components
fix the paths in `*.library.yml` file and in all dependent components
- Store all your components inside components/ folder
- Use twig namespaces inside your templates
(e.g.` @organisms/[component_name]/[component_name].twig`)
(https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules/components/understanding-twig-namespaces)
- Use JS webpack aliases for `import` directives instead of absolute or
relative paths (e.g. `import accordion from
"@organisms/[component_name]/[component_name].js";`)
(https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-webpack-alias)
- Use Bootstrap components from storybook or from the original Bootstrap
site in most cases (same for tags, structures, classes, etc.)

### **DO NOT**
- Create components without utilizing existing particles
- Use global CSS selectors, or selectors with common names
- Place components SCSS into one file or into global.scss
- Use custom mixins and variables as often as you can
- Store your images for the components wherever you want
- Make import SCSS files inside the *.story.js files (all SCSS will be
imported automatically. All SCSS, except those have the prefix “_”,
will be built into the dist folder)
- Place a lot of logic inside the twig template
- Store the paragraph's extra settings in fields
- Delete, replace, edit, refactor, rename any component or file you want
- Store your components wherever you want
